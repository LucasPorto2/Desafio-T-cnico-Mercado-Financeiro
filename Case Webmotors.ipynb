    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>O que vemos aqui é um comportamento bem diferente entre os estados ! Perceba que quase metade de todos os anúncios são de SP (47%) . Além disso, somente na região Sudeste temos 62% dos anúncios e quando pensamos nas duas regiões mais desenvolvidas do país juntas chegamos a ~ 84% . É importante destacar também que o número médio de leads por anúncio é visivelmente bem mais elevado na região Sudeste que possui 3 dos 4 estados melhores colocados nesse quesito (Acre está a frente de MG provavelmente porque sua amostra é pequena). Na região Sul apesar do alto número de anúncios não temos um número de leads médio tão considerável como na região Sudeste. Por fim vale destacar a liderança com muita margem de SP frente aos outros estados tanto em número de anúncios como em número médio de leads por anúncio."

Primeiro, o estimador é treinado no conjunto inicial de features e a importância de cada variável é obtida através de qualquer atributo específico (como coef_, feature_importances_) ou callable. Em seguida, as features menos importantes são removidos do conjunto atual de features. Esse procedimento é repetido recursivamente no conjunto podado até que o número desejado de features a serem selecionadas seja finalmente alcançado. O algoritmo RFECV ainda se utiliza da validação cruzada para determinar o número ótimo de features."

Isso pode levar ao overfitting uma vez que o modelo vê o mesmo exemplo mais de uma vez e, por isso, pode simplesmente memorizar o conjunto de treino e não conseguir generalizar para dados não vistos durante o treinamento."
